    <h2>About Skyron</h2>
    <div>
      <p><strong>Skyron</strong> is an Indian-born luxury sneaker brand that merges top-tier Chinese craftsmanship with bold Indian identity. Our mission is to redefine how India experiences streetwear and premium sneakers — by offering <strong>limited-edition, no-repeat styles</strong> directly to consumers who crave uniqueness and quality.</p>

      <p>We manufacture in select Chinese factories that produce for the world’s biggest luxury labels. Every Skyron pair is produced in <strong>strictly limited quantities</strong> — typically just 50 to 100 pairs per drop — giving each owner the confidence that they're wearing something no one else in their city likely has.</p>

      <p>Our design philosophy is global, but our spirit is unmistakably Indian. Whether it’s our collector edition cards, drop packaging, or our pricing model — we aim to <strong>deliver luxury without elitism</strong>.</p>

      <p>Skyron is more than a shoe — it's a movement for India's next generation of creators, rebels, and originals.</p>
